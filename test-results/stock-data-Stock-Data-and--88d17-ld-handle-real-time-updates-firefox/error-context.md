  - paragraph: How does 3Z Analysis Work?
  - paragraph: 3Z is a powerful financial tool coded in Python. I combine technical indicators with AI, global news and modelling to push our users the best possible trades.

  - paragraph: But why should I use 3Z?
  - paragraph: I believe that tangible results can be achieved alone on data analysis. Whether this is calculating means or generating weights based on the news, its possible, and maybe best, left to a computer. Consider the real worked example ahead.
